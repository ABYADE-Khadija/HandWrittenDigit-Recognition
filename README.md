# HandWrittenDigit-Recognition
HandWritten Digit Recognition

The purpose of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit classification using Python 
Technologies used 

    - Python Tiknter for user Interface
    
    - OpenCV for image processing  
    
    - Tensorflow for developing and running ML and DL applications.
    
    - Mnist DataSet consisting of over 60,000 images of handwritten digits for training and testing.
